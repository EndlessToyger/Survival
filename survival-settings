`xxxxFind` is a list that determines percentage of DCs for the find process. The DC is seeded at 5, and increments by 5 for each value less than the d100 roll. A list with a length of 4 has a max DC of 25 (initial 5, plus 4 possible increments of 5)

`xxxxHarvDC` defines the DC for 100% weight harvest. Set `"harvest"` to `"false"` if you want to turn off automatic harvesting at the server level. Leave `"true"` to allow users to customize by uvar or cvar. `"cooldown"` being set to `"true"` will turn on the cooldown timer. Be sure to set `"coolTime"` to something greater than `0`. Time is in seconds.'"""
